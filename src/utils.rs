//! Consensus module implementing HashGraph-like consensus for distributed voting
//!
//! This module implements the consensus protocol described in the [RFC](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index/blob/consensus-hashgraph-like/vac/raw/consensus-hashgraphlike.md)
//!
//! The consensus is designed to work with GossipSub-like networks and provides:
//! - Proposal management
//! - Vote collection and validation
//! - Consensus reached detection
